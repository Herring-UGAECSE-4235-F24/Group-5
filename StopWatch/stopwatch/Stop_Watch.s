@This is a delay program.  Your RP4 either runs at 1.5 or 1.8GHZ.  Using the program determine what speed your PI appears to be running
@Deliverable 1:  Calculate your RP4 clock speed.  Show how.
@Now let's make a stopwatch.   Use RP9:RP8:RP7 for minutes:seconds:hundredths of seconds.  Output the free running time to the terminal.  At 2:00:00, the stopwatch should go back to 0:00:00 and keep running.  The display
@output should be as described.
@You should look at the printloop.s example for the use of the printf command.  You will probably need to investigate formating using the asciz data type.
@Deliverable 2: your code on github and in your writeup.  We will check in class and look at accuracy as well.
	.global main
    .func main


main:
	
	ldr r1, =1 //(minutes)
